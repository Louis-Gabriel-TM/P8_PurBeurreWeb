# Pur Beurre on the Web (in progress)

This repository contains the Python / JavaScript / HTML 5 / CSS 3 scripts and additionnal files of my  __8th project__ for the __*Python Developer Path* in [*OpenClassrooms*](https://openclassrooms.com/paths/developpeur-se-dapplication-python)__.

This web application is based on the *Django* Python framework. It also uses *Bootstrap* and *jQuery* JavaScript libraries.

It exploits the *Open Food Facts* API to build a *PostgreSQL* database.
